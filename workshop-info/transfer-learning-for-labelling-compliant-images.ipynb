       "whether it be elevators, chairlifts, boilers or home renos. Large\n",
       "amounts of data are collected for inspection and inicdent alike. This\n",
       "data elucidates the state of building and maintenance practices, as\n",
       "well as accident prevention practices. Unfortunately, this data is\n",
